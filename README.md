# **Class Nameplate Detection**

It is a class signboard detection project. The dataset consists of images that have been given a bounding box for the location of the class signboard with the label "papan_nama". There is only 1 class, because the focus of this project is to detect the location of the class signboard, then the location is marked with a bounding box. 

The model uses InceptionV3 with a training process of 25 epochs.

Class detection accuracy shows 100% accuracy results on train and validation.

The trained model is converted with the .keras extension.
